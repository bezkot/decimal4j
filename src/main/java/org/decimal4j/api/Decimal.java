/**
 * Signed fixed-point decimal number similar to {@link BigDecimal}. A Decimal number can be immutable or mutable and it
 * is based on an underlying <i>unscaled</i> long value and a fixed {@link #getScale() scale}. The scale defines the
 * number of digits to the right of the decimal point. If the scale is {@code f} then the value represented by a
 * {@code Decimal} instance is <tt>(unscaledValue &times; 10<sup>-f</sup>)</tt>.
 * <p>
 * <i>Scale of Result and Operands</i> <br>
 * The result of an arithmetic operation is generally of the same scale as this Decimal unless otherwise indicated.
 * Decimal operands of arithmetic operations are typically also of the same scale as this Decimal. Scale compatibility
 * of Decimal operands is enforced through the generic {@link ScaleMetrics} parameter {@code <S>}.
 * <p>
 * <i>Operands involving Type Conversion</i> <br>
 * For convenience, arithmetic operations with other data types are sometimes also provided. Such operations usually
 * perform a value conversion into a Decimal of the current scale before performing the actual operation.
 * <p>
 * <i>Rounding</i> <br>
 * If the result of an arithmetic operation cannot be represented exactly in the scale of this Decimal, it is rounded to
 * the least significant digit. {@link RoundingMode#HALF_UP HALF_UP} rounding is used by default if no other rounding
 * mode is explicitly specified. Note that in a few exceptional cases {@link RoundingMode#HALF_EVEN HALF_EVEN} rounding
 * is used by default to comply with inherited specification constraints (e.g. see {@link #doubleValue()},
 * {@link #floatValue()} etc.). The documentation of operations which involve rounding indicate the rounding mode that
 * is applied.
 * <p>
 * <i>Overflows</i> <br>
 * Operations with Decimal values can lead to overflows in marked contrast to the {@link BigDecimal}. This is a direct
 * consequence of the construction of a Decimal value on the basis of a long value. Unless otherwise indicated
 * operations silently truncate overflows by default. This choice has been made for performance reasons and because Java
 * programmers are already familiar with this behavior from operations with primitive integer types. If this behavior is
 * inappropriate for an application, exceptions in overflow situations can be enforced through an optional
 * {@link OverflowMode} or {@link TruncationPolicy} argument. Some operations like conversion operations or arithmetic
 * operations involving conversion <i>always</i> throw an exception if an overflow occurs. The documentation of
 * operations which can cause an overflow always indicates the exact overflow behavior.
 * <p>
 * All methods for this interface throw {@code NullPointerException} when passed a {@code null} object reference for any
 * input parameter.
